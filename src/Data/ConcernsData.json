        "currentStatus": "Elliot Academies Foundation Trust has 39 schools in its network, spread across Birmingham, Hastings, London, and Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 2023 calendar year, Elliot Schools requested an in-year adjustment (IYA) of funding for two of its schools—Elliot Charter Academy and Elliot Alexandra—due to exceptional growth in pupil numbers in the 2023/24 academic year. The trust needed the funding adjustment to address the associated costs of this growth.\r\n\r\nIn the 2021/22 academic year, the trust requested IYA funding for seven schools. We initially approved the request for one school but refused the other six, including Elliot Alexandra. However, following a successful appeal from the trust, we subsequently approved IYA funding for Elliot Alexandra for both 2021/22 and 2022/23.\r\n\r\nThe 2022/23 request followed a 2017 arrangement with the trust, where we agreed to consider simplified business cases for IYA requests. One condition was that any estimated funding request for future years must be submitted in line with current departmental guidance, in a timely manner following the October pupil census, and with clear evidence of need. Any business cases submitted after this would be subject to standard departmental scrutiny.\r\n\r\nFor 2023/24, the trust submitted its initial request in November 2023. Following advice from funding colleagues, we requested additional information on two occasions. The final iteration of the business case was received on 11 April 2024. A decision was made in May 2024 not to approve the IYA request. The trust has since appealed the decision.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the IYA request, we identified wider potential long-term financial issues. The trust reported a cumulative surplus of £10.8m in its 2022/23 accounts, which was 4.3% of total revenue income. This surplus is forecast to decrease over the next three years to below 3% of income by 2025/26 (£710k; 0.27%). This is challenging and puts the trust’s resilience at risk if unexpected expenditure arises or pupil numbers fall short of projections. While there is low risk of short-term financial stress, careful management will be required to prevent further decline in cumulative surpluses. The trust’s cash balance remains healthy (£36.048m, 14.29% of income), and a current ratio of 1.4 indicates it can meet immediate liabilities.\r\n\r\nIn considering the appeal, we discussed the case with funding colleagues. Despite the additional information provided, the trust still does not meet the criteria for IYA funding. We considered alternative support to help cover the cost of growth, but due to the healthy cumulative reserves at trust level and the intra-academy loan facility available to the academies, the trust does not meet the requirements for alternative support at this stage.\r\n\r\nWe have held monthly KITs to date. In the November 2024 KIT, we agreed with the trust to review their overall financial position and forecast in the context of declining reserves. The trust agreed to provide a detailed cashflow forecast to evidence financial pressure and a detailed efficiency plan by the end of December 2024.\r\n\r\nIn March 2025, the trust reiterated plans to request a write-off of the £1.8m loan owed to the department. We are preparing a pro-forma template for the trust to use when submitting their business case to ensure we capture the essential background information for consideration.\r\n",

We requested an update on the impending business case in April and are still awaiting their response.\r\n",
