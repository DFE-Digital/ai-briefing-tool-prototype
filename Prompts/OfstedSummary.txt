If the document already has an "Ofsted ratings" section for data, below the data items but above the source link, summarise the data in no more than 3 short paragraphs. If the user has not requested that Ofsted data is included in the document, and therefore there is no "Ofsted ratings" section, create one, and in there summarise the most recent 3 years' worth of data without presenting the data itself. Cite the source and link to it at the bottom of the section.
